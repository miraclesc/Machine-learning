After you have completed the feature extraction functions, 
the next step of ex6 spam will load a preprocessed training dataset 
that will be used to train a SVM classifier.

while spamTest.mat contains 1000 test examples. 
Each original email was processed using the processEmail 
and emailFeatures functions and converted into a vector.
